V2
---------

TODO
- move sensor widget to static page; send only percents and value - update via js
- more widget types
- config files location? SPLIT CONFIG AND SENSORS DATA FILES
- add `execute' sensor type, to read input data from stdout of executed binary?
- dran-n-drop for groups and sensors? css+js can do that!
- css chooser: light theme, for slow browsers, etc...
- background colors for groups
- auth, roles, RO mode, https? decide with that
- advanced sensor creation: specify input file (full path) directly, i.e. 
    /sys/devices/0020:1022:0001.0001/HID-SENSOR-200041.1.auto/iio:device0/in_illuminance_raw
