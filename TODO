TUNE
- system info: mem, date, uptime, la
- more accurate divider and units prediction for inputs
- more info popups (after scan with hints, value too large, etc)

BUGZ
- why second connected browser restarts on ws ops?
- no `first scan` events on sensor start

TODO
- help page
- advanced sensor creation: specify input file (full path) directly, i.e. 
    /sys/devices/0020:1022:0001.0001/HID-SENSOR-200041.1.auto/iio:device0/in_illuminance_raw

TODO
- config files location? SPLIT CONFIG AND SENSORS DATA JSON
- add `execute' sensor type, to read input data from stdout of executed binary?
- look into amdgpu/device: many many sensors we didn't detect on scan
- dran-n-drop for groups and sensors? css+js can do that!
- css selector: light theme, for slow browsers, etc...
- background colors for groups
